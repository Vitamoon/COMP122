# COMP122 Semiconductor Company Revenue Analysis

For best results, use the file "kyimDatasetInvestigation.ipynb" as it is properly formatted.
Basically, I analyzed a semiconductor company market revenue worldwide from 2009 to 2022 chart from Statista.
The findings were that:

The company with the largest growth was Samsung Electronics with 47.84 billion dollars more revenue in the final reported year than the first reported year.
This was a 269.5211267605634 percent increase in revenue.

The company with the highest year-over-year gain was AMD at 6.81 percent per year.
The previous company mentioned above ( Samsung Electronics ) had a 4.745 annual revenue increase.

Intel had the highest total cumulative revenue at 778.33 billion dollars over the reported time period.

Thus if I had to invest in only one of the companies on the datasheet as a consumer, I would likely invest in **Samsung** because of the large growth the company has experienced. **AMD** would also be a good choice from the data results above but because it only has entries for three years of data the numbers could be unreliable. If I were a hedge fund manager, I would invest in **Intel** because they have produced earnings reliably for a long time.
